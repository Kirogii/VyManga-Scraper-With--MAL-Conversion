# THINGS YOU'RE GOING TO NEED:
 - Python

## RUN THIS COMMAND IN PYTHON:
```sh
pip install requests
```

# TO INSTALL THE EXTENSION:
 - Goto:  
   `chrome://extensions/`  
 - On the top right corner, click the switch for developer mode  
 - Click "Load Unpacked" and select the extracted extension folder  
 - Done  

# TO CONVERT THE TXT:
 - Goto the Python script `Convert.py` that we downloaded  
 - Open it up; it should pop up a menu for a MAL username. Just input your username you used to registerâ€”it will use an API to grab the ID (this is used for the config)  
 - Then it should pop up a window for selecting files. Select the TXT file that you downloaded from the extension  
 - Wait for it to finish; it takes a while
