# TO CONVERT THE TXT:
 - Goto the Python script `Convert.py` that we downloaded  
 - Open it up; it should pop up a menu for a MAL username. Just input your username you used to registerâ€”it will use an API to grab the ID (this is used for the config)  
 - Then it should pop up a window for selecting files. Select the TXT file that you downloaded from the extension  
 - Wait for it to finish; it takes a while
